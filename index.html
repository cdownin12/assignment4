    <p> Hey there. This here is a blog all about Krispy Kreme donuts.
        Made my an avid fan, these donuts hold a special place in my heart. Here on the main page, I'll discuss what makes them so stinkin' great. For a flavor analysis, go ahead and click the link that says "explore flavors", and if you just want to get hungry, there's a photo gallery under "see pictures". To hear more of my personal connection with this franchise, go ahead and click on the "Blog" tab.

        Now that you know what you're doing, let me give you some reasons why what seems like such a simple pastry warrants an entire site - for a grade nonetheless!

    <ol>
        <li>The Hot Light. </li>
        <li>They're fluffier due to the frying process, not baked and dry like other franchises</li>
        <li> The glazes are melt-in-your-mouth delicious; no one does confectinonary glaze like KK does</li>
        <li> Their seasonal flavors are too precious for words, perfect for the 'gram, and bring happiness just by looking at them (seriously, did you SEE the bunny butts they did one year? If not, you KNOW they're in that photo gallery.)</li>
        <li>Their whole aesthetic is this cute, retro style donut shack and they have the hats to prove it</li>
    </ol>
